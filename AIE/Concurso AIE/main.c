/*
 * 3pi-mazesolver - demo code for the Pololu 3pi Robot
 * 
 * This code will solve a line maze constructed with a black line on a
 * white background, as long as there are no loops.  It has two
 * phases: first, it learns the maze, with a "left hand on the wall"
 * strategy, and computes the most efficient path to the finish.
 * Second, it follows its most efficient solution.
